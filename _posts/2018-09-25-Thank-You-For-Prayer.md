###Thank You...
Hi guys! 

If you are reading this I just wanted to thank you all for your prayers and encouragement. The love we continue to receive from strangers is unbelievable and we cannot thank you enough for praying for our family. 

The fact that many people are willing to share our story to their church or family and pray for daddy's (Mikes's) healing is amazing. I believe that your prayers are the reason we are getting by. Each day is so challenging and hard at times. 

Last week Mike had an unbelievable dialysis treatment that was so painful (fistula hurt) he was taken to the emergency where they then admitted him. They noticed he wasn't getting good blood flow to his hand and he needed surgery Monday to reduce the fistula for dailysis. As far as we know surgery went well, however he is still there and will remain till we find out if the surgery worked, so that he can continue dialysis. 

As a young mother it is hard to face something like this but knowing others are praying for our family all around the world is encouraging. You all that have messaged, liked, commented or shared our story I can't thank you enough. My two childrens' spirit was uplifted when I showed them how many people were helping them pray for their daddy. We love you all, thank you so much! God bless.
