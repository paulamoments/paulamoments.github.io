###Thoughts for today...

I often write in a journal or my notes on my phone to express what I am going through at the time. It's my therapy besides talking to God or a professional. I decided to blog because Mike and I are very normal people who so happen to love God and are facing daily trials and worry like anyone else. I realized sometimes ones testimony can help another and if our story helps you or even if your testimony helps me than our jobs are done. 

Every night my daughter has asked if daddy is coming home yet (from the hospital or dialysis clinic), and pouts saying daddy is going to be there forever. As a mother, each time it gets harder to respond "he's just getting medicine he'll be back". Because the truth is I worry there will be a day he won't. 

I am not going to lie, I have my up and down days of doubt and worry, but I whole heartedly believe God is going to see us through this. Deep down I know His will will be done in our lives, but as humans we still have those thoughts of worry in the back of our minds. If I write about my worry or fear, know that I trust God's hand is upon us. I am just expressing what I am feeling in that moment. I sometimes wonder if I am alone in this, or do others fear just as much? I find myself saying, "God are you there, Is this going to be over soon?"
