Normally I wouldn't address this, and if you know me than you know I am usually quiet and ignore such things. Because we have gained some attention I felt the need to elaborate about my intentions on sharing our journey. My husband was unfortunately brought in by ambulance today, and as I sit and wait to find out results I am reading through comments and messages for encouragement, feeling overwhelmed at the moment. 

Over the last couple days I've recieved hurtful comments and messages regarding my parenting and more. To be honest it is one of the reasons I waited so long to share publicly what we are going through. Being vulnerable with your feelings is hard sometimes and I usually just deal with these things on my own and move on, but this time I just couldn't. Not all feedback we have recieved is negative and to those who give encouraging, loving, and caring advice and messages, or even share your stories we are truly grateful. You have no idea the impact and encouragement it has had on us. Truth be told we have some days that are harder than others, and reading similar stories or encouraging messages helps us to know we are not the only ones facing difficult situations or in a tough place. 

I never want people to question me as a person, wife or a parent. My intentions are pure - I do not get pleasure or gain anything from sharing our story other than knowing that there is an amazing amount of people willing to pray for us. I would never intentionally blast my children for attention. I simply want my children to know that there are others out there helping them pray beyond our circle, whether that'd be for healing or even strength to get by day to day. 

I feel helpless and believe there's a God, I know prayer is the most powerful thing. So I thought asking for more prayer, even if it touched 1 or 3 strangers to pray for us, is better than going to bat alone (Matthew 18:19-20). Hearing my children cry or ask questions no child at their age should worry about is tough. I didn't think asking for such thing would offend anyone, I love my children more than anything and It sucks what we are going through this. I am sorry if what I post is offensive or wrong those were never my intentions. However thanks to those who have prayed for our family and continue to do so. Every day is different and we are just trying to get by and live life as normal as possible.
